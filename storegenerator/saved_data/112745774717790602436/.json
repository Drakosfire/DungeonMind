Every shelf is overloaded with peculiar artifacts that seem to whisper secrets from worlds unknown. Started by the enigmatic Jolly Jumble, a gnome renowned for his adventuring days and accumulation of bizarre collectibles. Jolly retired from quests and channeled all his chaotic energy into curating a store where everything has a story behind it. Notorious for having the most unpredictable stock, regulars know not to ask for specifics but to immerse themselves in the randomness that is the Emporium."
